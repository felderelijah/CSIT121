	<p>The &quot;Maryland Crab Dip&quot; is my favorite recipe because it's simple and easy to make. There are many things that compliment crab dip to eat it with ranging from french fries just like how they serve it at Camden Yards which is my favorite combination. There are also options such as Ritz Crackers, toasted wedges, celery, and bread that taste delicious with it. If i had an option I would eat this everyday, I already eat it everytime I get the chance to. </p>
