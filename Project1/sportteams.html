<h2>Baltimore Ravens</h2>
<p>How could one not like that purple and gold! Born and raised in Baltimore, MD this was bound to be my favorite team.</p>
<h2>Miami Heat</h2>
<p>SOUTH BEACH explains for itself, the atmosphere around this team is electrifying and like no other. I also love the team coaching staff and players.</p>
<h2>Baltimore Orioles</h2>
<p>Again another hometown team. I have been going to Camden Yards for years. I love the food, people, and the history behind the team.</p>
