<h2>HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3</h2>
<p>This cinematic masterpiece is #1 on my all time list of movies. I remember being a kid rushing to the movie theater to catch this movie. In my opinion best Disney movie hands down out of the series!</p>
<h2>Grown Ups</h2>
<p>This movie alone I could probably watch everyday for a week straight. This movie was nothing but pure joy and comedy.</p>
<h2>Harry Potter</h2>
<p>The Harry Potter time was a time to be alive. The movies series on that impressed many especially me.</p>
